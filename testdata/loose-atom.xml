    <summary>&lt;p&gt;The latest update for TIM 1531 IRC fixes a vulnerability. The devices was missing proper authentication when connecting on port 102/tcp, although configured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker needs to be able to connect to port 102/tcp of an affected device in order to exploit this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform administrative operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens has released updates for TIM 1531 IRC modules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SSA-674165 (Last Update: 2018-12-11): Vulnerability in McAfee MACC product for SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 drives</title>
    <updated>2018-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-674165.pdf" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;McAfee has issued Security Bulletin SB10250 to address a vulnerabilty in McAfee Application and Change Control (MACC). SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives with HMIs produced between November 4th, 2015 and October 9th, 2018, use MACC as part of their software package, if option A30 was part of the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens has analyzed the vulnerability and has determined that this vulnerability applies to these HMIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMIs with this vulnerability can be compromised via local attack using removable USB storage devices to transfer malicious files. These file can be executed to compromise the HMI and by extension the drive system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For compatibility reasons, Siemens advises the installation of MACC 8.2.0 instead of version 8.0.0, hotfix 5 as mentioned in SB10250.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Several industrial devices are affected by two vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition via PROFINET DCP network packets under certain circumstances. Precondition for this scenario is a direct Layer 2 access to the affected products. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens has released updates for several affected products, is working on updates for the remaining affected products and recommends specific countermeasures until fixes are available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Multiple vulnerabilities affecting WPA/WPA2 implementations were identified by a researcher and publicly disclosed under the term &amp;quot;Key Reinstallation Attacks&amp;quot; (KRACK). These vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker within the radio range of the wireless network to decrypt, replay or inject forged network packets into the wireless communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Siemens Industrial products use WPA/WPA2 and are therefore affected by some of the vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;The latest update for the Siveillance VMS Video mobile app for Android and iOS fixes a security vulnerability that could allow an attacker in a privileged network position to read data from and write data to the encrypted communication channel between the app and a server. Precondition for this scenario is that an attacker is able to intercept the communication channel between the affected app and a server, and is also able to generate a certificate that results for the validation algorithm in a checksum identical to a trusted certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SSA-470231 (Last Update: 2018-02-22): TPM Vulnerability in SIMATIC IPCs</title>
    <updated>2018-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-470231.pdf" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Several SIMATIC IPCs include a version of Infineon's Trusted Platform Module (TPM) firmware that mishandles RSA key generation. This makes it easier for attackers to conduct cryptographic attacks against the key material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens has released updates for the affected Industrial PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SSA-856721 (Last Update: 2018-02-22): Vulnerability in RUGGEDCOM Discovery Protocol (RCDP) of Industrial Communication Devices</title>
    <updated>2018-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-856721.pdf" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;The RUGGEDCOM RCDP protocol is not properly configured after commissioning of RUGGEDCOM ROS based devices and some SCALANCE X switch models and could allow unauthenticated remote users to perform administrative operations. An attacker must be in the same adjacent network and the RCDP daemon must be enabled in order to exploit the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens has released updates for all affected products and recommends that customers update to the new versions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-901333.pdf" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Multiple vulnerabilities affecting WPA/WPA2 implementations were identified by a researcher and publicly disclosed under the term &amp;quot;Key Reinstallation Attacks&amp;quot; (KRACK). These vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker within the radio range of the wireless network to decrypt, replay or inject forged network packets into the wireless communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Siemens Industrial products use WPA/WPA2 and are therefore affected by some of the vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Several industrial devices are affected by a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition via PROFINET DCP network packets under certain circumstances. Precondition for this scenario is a direct Layer 2 access to the affected products. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.&lt;/p&gt;
